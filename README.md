# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
#### The purpose of this project is to solve a credit card risk by applying machine learning. 
#### In this sense, ***imbalanced-learn*** and ***scikit-learn*** techniques are used to build and evaluate models using resampling. 
#### Besides,  ***RandomOverSampler*** and ***SMOTE*** algorithms are used to oversample the data while ***ClusterCentroids*** algorithm are used to undersample the data. 
#### As requested a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling is performed by usign ***SMOTEENN*** algorithm. 
#### To predict credit risk, the two new machine learning models that reduce bias (***BalanceRandomForestClassifier*** and ***EasyEmsembleClassifier***) are compared. 
Additionally, a recommendation on wether they shoudl be used to predict credit risk is requested.
